Welcome to EERL's Chemical Database
###################################

This database is to provided students, staff, and visitors with information on the chemicals used by EERL.  Here, we track the specific chemicals used, their current locations and vessel types (where applicable) and provide links to appropriate Safety Data Sheets (SDS).

**What this is**

   A means to relay to others the chemical hazards when working in our labs and where they might be found, and a means to quickly access safety information.

**What this is not**

   A means to track the inventory of chemicals.
